# Shape-Class
A program which draws different types of shapes based on specifications given by the user.
This abstract Shape class inherits from JFrame, meaning it displays a graphical window and has a paint method it can use. The shape only has 2 static attributes: a JPanel for the JFrame, and a constant dimension for said JPanel, set to 500 pixels. Regardless, this Shape class acts as a template for the Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, and Square classes that inherit from it. It is abstract, and not an interface because while some methods are abstract and undefined, others like draw() and paint() have a body and are the same regardless of the type of Shape as the child class. The other methods though, are all abstract, meaning only the name, parameters, and return type is defined, whereas any class that inherits from Shape MUST define those classes.
